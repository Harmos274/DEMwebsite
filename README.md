# Introduction
Deux Ex Machina Production's landing page project.

### Project context
I am a part of a film making association since high school, we make principally some shorts movies. Sometimes we need 
for founding, and we search for third-party commands to finance us. Having a website, and using it as a portfolio 
will be a great opportunity for us to reach a larger audience and maybe convince more third-party actors to trust us for their projects.

### Functional goal
The project must :

- Present the association members,
- Present some of our projects as a portfolio,
- Give visitors a way to contact us,

The UI is the biggest part of the project since it is the best way to make us rememberable.

### Technical environment

The site will be written in VueJS, with GitHub as version manager. Docker will be use for easy deployment and portability.

Languages/Framework:

- HTML5/CSS3
- SASS
- NodeJS
- VueJS
- Cypress

Environment:
- Github

Resources:
- API Youtube

### Project description
First there will be a page with a short presentation of the association. The aim is to trigger the interest of the website 
visitor, so they will stay to the website for further information about us.

Next, there will be a portfolio with some of our project, illustrating what we can do with a camera. There will be a use 
of the Youtube API to embed some of our projects available in Youtube.

Finally, a “Contact us” page will be available in order to send us emails.
